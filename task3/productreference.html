                    gladly guide you as much or as little as you’d like through our comprehensive and transparent
                    swimwear production process. If you have questions, and are new to this – we’ll guide you all the
                    way. Our mission has always been to help independent entrepreneurs bring their swimwear dreams to
                    life, with reduced impact on the environment. ALWAYS ETHICAL – ECO OPTIONS We pride ourselves on
                    offering you ethical swimwear manufacturing at a good price point; and include recycled and
                    sustainable ECONYL® and REPREVE® fabrics in our range. You can choose eco options of almost
                    everything we offer making a fully sustainable swim line. On our end we donate proceeds of our
                    profits for ocean cleanup as one of many initiatives for sustainable manufacturing. Our working
                    conditions are in many regards to western standards. SWIMSUIT SPECIALISTS – BIKINI NERDS We have the
                    know-how to simplify the journey for you – from design to shop by offering you a one-stop-shop
                    solution including sourcing, sample development, bulk production, quality control and everything
                    else until finished product at your door. Our manufacturing pathways encompass two major private
                    label options: your custom designs and our ready designs. With ready design we launch new designs
                    seasonally that you can put your label on with your own tweaks. You can also combine our designs
                    with yours. This makes starting a swim line so much easier.</p>
